kspacelib
Reads ships and parts from an installed copy of Kerbal Space Program.

Once the ships and parts are loaded, there are convenience functions to allow various analyses 
to be performed on the ships.

This is really new at the moment, and there isn't much in the way of aggregate or convenience functions available yet.

Basic usage:

    import kspace
    kspace.set_game_path("C:\\games\\KSP_win")
    kspace.Part.load_all()
    ships = kspace.Ship.load_all()

    ship = ships[0]
    print "Ship name:", ship.name, "with", len(ship.stages), "stages."
    launch_stage = ship.stages[-1]
    mass_at_launch = launch_stage.mass()
    print "thrusters at launch:", launch_stage.available_thrusters()
